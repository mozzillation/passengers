            <p>The technology we thought we were using to make life more efficient started using us some time ago. It is now attempting to reshape our social behaviour into patterns reminiscent of the total surveillance culture. We risk allowing ourselves to become a vast network of informants on each other and ourselves. The idea behind this work is to reflect on the loss of control of our data.</p>

            <p>People constantly pass through spaces, but something remains: are we all ingenuous information broadcasters? PA:SS:EN:GE:RS is a small device that allows to create a virtual crowd by storing wifi signals from everyone around, making them persistent and visible to everyone, printing an unique ID of our personal devices.</p>

            <p>Starting from the concept of improper accessibility, the device thinks about the issue of personal data and on the unaware life that these have outside of our control. The installation consists of a machine capable of collecting such data in an improper way, collecting them without the owners' awareness. In fact, the devices release these data unknowingly.</p>

            <p>This device is a “real-time exhibition”, a concept of Franco Vaccari, developed during <i>Biennale di Venezia</i> ’72. He created performances that self-generate or self-build through the use of the photographic medium, such as <i>Esposizione in tempo reale N. 4. Lascia sulle pareti una traccia fotografica del tuo passaggio.</i></p>

            <p>This device acts like a parasite inside an environment, self-perpetuating, able to steal information from surrounding people. As Vaccari works, the visitor thus becomes an active (and involuntary) participant, part of the creation, leaving a digital trace of its passage. They might have left us physically, but their virtual presence will stay with us.</p>
